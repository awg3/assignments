## Welcome
This project represents the content site for Videri, it is a routed React application.

## Get Started
- Get [node and install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
- In your terminal, at the folder root of this project use the commands:
* `npm i` or `yarn add` to install dependencies.
* `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the application.

Enjoy!

## Note:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Comments:
- There are no specifications regarding the share icon functionality or why it had to be there, the API results do not show a parameter which indicates that sharing should even occur. Therefore, an image element is in place as a "demo" for what could be.
- The repository name is mocked, meaning there is no specific API call currently that fetches the repository one currently is looking at.
- I could not find any videos on the Pixabay API calls that I made, therefore I was not able to prepare the Modal component to handle the styling of a video nor the HTML for it.
- images pertaining to the section to the left of the search bar, the drag and drop and other, were not provided and as such, I added a placeholder image.
- I meant to test CSS transitions more, specifically regarding the responsive grid layout, in order for the elements to smoothly move around.

## TDD:
No unit tests currently present, I plan to add them in the next iteration.
